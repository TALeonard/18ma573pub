The file is getting cumbersome by uploading some previous classes repeatly. 
Tired? Now we are going to wrap those useful classes into a py file and simply import it before it's used.
Next, we follow these steps below to reproduce 
the previous bsm_formula notebook - [ipynb](https://github.com/songqsh/18ma573pub/blob/master/src/bsm_formula_v01.ipynb)

- create "european_options_class.py" by copy/paste of "European_Option" class in the previous 
[ipynb](src/european_options_class.ipynb)
- Similarly create "sde_class.py" by cutting relevant code to the Gbm class from [ipynb](src/bsm_formula_v01.ipynb)
