        "- plot a figure of strike v.s. IV. Do you find any volatility smile? \n",
        "- calibrate bsm volatility for the option prices, denote it by $\\hat \\sigma$. You may use any error function for the calibration purpose.\n",
        "- reproduce option prices using your price engine with calibrated volatility, then compare how close they are to the market prices.\n"
